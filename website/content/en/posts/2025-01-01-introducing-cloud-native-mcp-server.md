Cloud Native MCP Server represents a breakthrough in cloud-native infrastructure management, combining the power of 10 essential services with 220+ tools into a single, unified interface that enables AI-assisted operations like never before.

## The Challenge of Modern Infrastructure

Today's cloud-native environments are incredibly complex. Organizations manage applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters, utilize dozens of monitoring tools, and struggle with fragmented toolsets that don't speak the same language. Engineers spend more time context-switching between tools than actually optimizing their infrastructure.

## Our Solution: Unified Management

Cloud Native MCP Server addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Unified API**: A single endpoint for all infrastructure operations
- **AI Integration**: Natural language infrastructure management through LLM integration
- **Comprehensive Toolset**: 220+ tools across 10 services including Kubernetes, Helm, Grafana, Prometheus, and more
- **Performance Optimized**: Built-in caching, connection pooling, and intelligent request handling

## Key Features

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Support
Our implementation of the MCP standard allows AI assistants to seamlessly interact with your infrastructure, enabling operations like "Scale the frontend deployment to 10 replicas" or "Show me all alerts from the last hour."

### 10 Integrated Services
Rather than juggling multiple tools, you get:
- Kubernetes management with 28 specialized tools
- Helm package management with 31 deployment tools
- Grafana dashboards and alerts with 36 visualization tools
- Prometheus metrics with 20 querying tools
- Kibana log analysis with 52 search tools
- And much more

### Security-First Architecture
We've built security into every layer, with support for API keys, JWT tokens, and Basic Auth, plus comprehensive audit logging for all operations.
